Task 2: What is `#!/bin/bash`? Can we write `#!/bin/sh` as well?

#!/bin/bash` is called a "shebang" line. It indicates that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

#!/bin/bash`: Uses Bash as the interpreter. It supports advanced features like arrays, associative arrays, and functions.

#!/bin/sh`: Uses the Bourne shell. Itâ€™s more POSIX-compliant and is generally compatible with different Unix shells.
